## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have the following installed and configured:

1.  **Docker:** Install Docker Desktop (Windows/macOS) or Docker Engine (Linux). [Download Docker](https://www.docker.com/get-started)
2.  **Git:** Required for cloning this repository (if applicable) and managing source code. [Download Git](https://git-scm.com/downloads)
3.  **Docker Hub Account:** Create a free account on [Docker Hub](https://hub.docker.com/). You'll need your username.
4.  **GitHub Account:** You already have one if you're reading this on GitHub.
5.  **GitHub Personal Access Token (PAT):** For pushing to GHCR, you need a PAT with the `write:packages` scope.
    *   Go to GitHub Settings -> Developer settings -> Personal access tokens -> Tokens (classic).
    *   Generate a new token (classic).
    *   Give it a descriptive name (e.g., `ghcr-push`).
    *   Select the `write:packages` scope.
    *   Generate the token and **copy it immediately**. You won't see it again. **Never commit your PAT to your repository!**

## Project Structure

Your project directory should look like this:

```
.
├── Dockerfile
├── app.py
└── README.md
```

## Step 1: Create the Python Application

Create a simple Python script named `app.py` that prints "Hello, Docker World!".

**`app.py`**:
```python
# Simple Python script to print a message
print("Hello, Docker World!")
```

This is the application we will containerize.

## Step 2: Create the Dockerfile

Create a file named `Dockerfile` (no extension) in the same directory. This file contains instructions for Docker to build the image.

**`Dockerfile`**:
```dockerfile
# Use an official Python runtime as a parent image
# Using a slim version to keep the image size small
FROM python:3.9-slim

# Set the working directory inside the container
WORKDIR /app

# Copy the current directory contents into the container at /app
COPY . /app

# Define the command to run your application
# This command runs when the container launches
CMD ["python", "./app.py"]
```

**Explanation:**

*   `FROM python:3.9-slim`: Specifies the base image to use. We're starting with a lightweight official Python 3.9 image.
*   `WORKDIR /app`: Sets the working directory inside the container to `/app`. Any subsequent `COPY`, `RUN`, `CMD` commands will execute relative to this directory.
*   `COPY . /app`: Copies the contents of the current directory (where the `Dockerfile` is located) into the `/app` directory inside the container. In this case, it copies `app.py`.
*   `CMD ["python", "./app.py"]`: Specifies the default command to run when a container is started from this image. It executes `python ./app.py`.

## Step 3: Build the Docker Image

Open your terminal or command prompt, navigate to the directory containing your `Dockerfile` and `app.py`, and run the following command:

```bash
docker build -t hello-docker-world:latest .
```

**Explanation:**

*   `docker build`: The command to build an image from a Dockerfile.
*   `-t hello-docker-world:latest`: Tags the image.
    *   `hello-docker-world` is the name of the image.
    *   `:latest` is the tag (often representing the latest version). You can use specific versions like `:1.0`.
*   `.`: Specifies the build context (the current directory). Docker looks for the `Dockerfile` here and sends files from this directory to the Docker daemon.

After the build completes successfully, you can verify the image was created:

```bash
docker images
```

You should see `hello-docker-world` listed with the `latest` tag.

## Step 4: Run the Docker Container

Now, run a container based on the image you just built:

```bash
docker run --rm hello-docker-world:latest
```

**Explanation:**

*   `docker run`: The command to create and start a new container from an image.
*   `--rm`: Automatically removes the container when it exits. This is useful for short-lived containers like this one to keep things clean.
*   `hello-docker-world:latest`: The name and tag of the image to use.

You should see the following output in your terminal:

```
Hello, Docker World!
```

This confirms your application is running correctly inside the Docker container.

## Step 5: Push the Image to Docker Hub

To share your image or use it elsewhere, you can push it to a container registry like Docker Hub.

1.  **Tag the image for Docker Hub:**
    You need to tag your image with your Docker Hub username. Replace `your-dockerhub-username` with your actual Docker Hub username.

    ```bash
    docker tag hello-docker-world:latest your-dockerhub-username/hello-docker-world:latest
    # You can also add a specific version tag
    # docker tag hello-docker-world:latest your-dockerhub-username/hello-docker-world:1.0
    ```

2.  **Log in to Docker Hub:**
    Use the `docker login` command. You'll be prompted for your Docker Hub username and password (or an access token if you have 2FA enabled).

    ```bash
    docker login
    ```

3.  **Push the image:**
    Push the tagged image to Docker Hub.

    ```bash
    docker push your-dockerhub-username/hello-docker-world:latest
    # If you tagged with a version:
    # docker push your-dockerhub-username/hello-docker-world:1.0
    ```

    After the push completes, your image will be available on your Docker Hub profile (e.g., `https://hub.docker.com/r/your-dockerhub-username/hello-docker-world`).

## Step 6: Push the Image to GitHub Container Registry (GHCR)

You can also push your image to GitHub's own container registry.

1.  **Tag the image for GHCR:**
    Tag your image using the GHCR format: `ghcr.io/YOUR_GITHUB_USERNAME/IMAGE_NAME:TAG`. Replace `your-github-username` with your **lowercase** GitHub username. The image name can be the same as your repository name or something else like `hello-docker-world`.

    ```bash
    # Make sure to use your LOWERCASE GitHub username
    docker tag hello-docker-world:latest ghcr.io/your-github-username/hello-docker-world:latest
    # Example using repo name (replace 'your-repo-name'):
    # docker tag hello-docker-world:latest ghcr.io/your-github-username/your-repo-name:latest
    ```

2.  **Log in to GHCR:**
    Use `docker login` with the GHCR server address. Use your GitHub username and the Personal Access Token (PAT) you created in the prerequisites **as the password**.

    ```bash
    # Replace YOUR_GITHUB_USERNAME with your actual GitHub username (case might matter here, try lowercase first)
    docker login ghcr.io -u YOUR_GITHUB_USERNAME
    ```

    *   **Username:** Enter your GitHub username.
    *   **Password:** Paste your GitHub Personal Access Token (PAT) with `write:packages` scope.

    *Security Note:* For automated environments (like GitHub Actions), it's better to pipe the token via stdin:
    `echo $CR_PAT | docker login ghcr.io -u YOUR_GITHUB_USERNAME --password-stdin` (where `CR_PAT` is an environment variable holding your PAT).

3.  **Push the image:**
    Push the tagged image to GHCR. Ensure the image name matches the one you used in the `docker tag` command.

    ```bash
    docker push ghcr.io/your-github-username/hello-docker-world:latest
    # Or if you used your repo name:
    # docker push ghcr.io/your-github-username/your-repo-name:latest
    ```

    After the push completes, your image will be available in the "Packages" section of your GitHub profile or repository. The image will likely be private by default unless your repository is public and you adjust package visibility settings.

## Cleaning Up

To remove the container (if you didn't use `--rm`), the image, and log out:

```bash
# List running/stopped containers (optional)
docker ps -a

# Stop a specific container (if needed, replace <container_id>)
# docker stop <container_id>

# Remove a specific container (if needed, replace <container_id>)
# docker rm <container_id>

# Remove the built images (use the names/tags you created)
docker rmi hello-docker-world:latest
docker rmi your-dockerhub-username/hello-docker-world:latest  # If tagged for Docker Hub
docker rmi ghcr.io/your-github-username/hello-docker-world:latest # If tagged for GHCR (use actual name/tag)

# Log out from registries (optional)
# docker logout
# docker logout ghcr.io
```

Happy Dockering!
